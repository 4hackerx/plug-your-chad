Plug Your Chad (PYC) is a project that makes coding with AI a breeze. It's got two main parts: a VS Code extension and a Chrome extension.

The VS Code extension is where the real action happens. It lets you chat with AI language models (LLMs) right in your code editor. Stuck on a problem? Just ask the LLM for help, and it'll give you suggestions and answers without you ever having to leave VS Code.

But here's the cool part: the Chrome extension lets you connect to any chatbot website out there. No matter what LLM or API they use, PYC can plug right in. This means you're not stuck with just one AI - you can take your pick and code with any chatbot you like. It's all about flexibility and freedom.

But coding with AI isn't just a solo gig. PYC also has a LLaMa Party feature, which is like a virtual hangout for coders. You can invite your friends or teammates to join in and collaborate with an LLM you may have access to together. Everyone can pitch in by streaming tokens to the host, making it a real team effort. It's a great way to share an LLM say only you have with a team, even if you're not in the same room.

PYC is all about making coding with AI easy, fun, and accessible to everyone. Whether you're a coding pro or just starting out, PYC has got your back. It's not about fancy jargon or complicated setups - it's about getting stuff done and enjoying the process.

So if you want to take your coding to the next level with AI, give PYC a shot. It might just change the way you code forever.
